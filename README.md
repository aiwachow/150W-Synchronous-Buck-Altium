## Testing
**Warning!** PCB has been manufactured, assembled and tested. Due to lack of choosen inductor at the distributor, tests were made with unsuitable one, for this reason, the inductor enters pulse mode and buck gives not 12V but 7V on the output. 
However, no other errors were detected so finall test will be carried out when new inductor arrive.  <br /> **In addition, pcb and gerber files will be made available when the power supply is 100% working**
